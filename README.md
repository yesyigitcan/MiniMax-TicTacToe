# MiniMax-TicTacToe
Model intelligence implementation on a tic tac toe game by using Mini-Max algorithm

You play the game on your terminal. You need to enter a row number (0, 1, 2) and then a column number (0, 1, 2) for a 3x3 TicTacToe matrix. You will see the board and possible states of the model with state values for your each move.
